Below is an outline for my final project for MAP 671.  I include what I plan to map and how, as well as when my information originates.

## My plan for the map

I plan to map contained, active landfills throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  I will insert data points into a mapbox dataset and use Mapbox.com to create and style my map.  The finished map and all accompanying infomation will be available on a webpage by the completion of this project.
