Below is an outline for my final project for MAP 671.  I include what I plan to map and how, as well as when my information originates.

## My plan for the map

I plan to map residential landfills throughout the state of Kentucky.  I will insert data points into a mapbox dataset and use Mapbox.com to create and style my map.


## Information Sources
The Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet has published documents regarding solid waste, which are available to the public.  https://eec.ky.gov/Environmental-Protection/Waste/Pages/Solid-Waste-Facility-Reports.aspx

Data will be obtained from the Solid Waste Branch Facility Report, published on April 12, 2021.
